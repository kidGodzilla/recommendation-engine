# Recommendation-engine

This is a client-side computed recommendation-engine based on user affinity, written in JavaScript, using firebase as a datastore.

It uses Facebook connect to gather information about a user's favorite movies and provide recommendations on other movies the user might like.

## What?

Yes, it's kind of bizarre to write a recommendation engine in client-side JavaScript.

This is only my second recommendation engine and I threw it together rather quickly (~6 hrs). If you see this and have any ideas for improvements, please feel free to raise an issue or submit a pull request.

## Does it work?

Yes, to some extent. Probably doesn't scale well.
