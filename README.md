This is a *client-side-computed recommendation-engine* based on user affinity, written in JavaScript, using **Firebase** for persistence.

It uses **Facebook Login** to gather information about a user's favorite movies and then provides recommendations on other movies the user might like by randomly recommending other movies similar users liked.

The look and feel has been improved by using **Twitter Bootstrap** & Hubspot's **Messenger.js**.

## What?

Yes, it's kind of bizarre to write a recommendation engine in client-side JavaScript.

This is only my second recommendation engine and I threw it together rather quickly (~6 hrs). If you see this and have any ideas for improvements, please feel free to raise an issue or submit a pull request.

## Does it work?

Yes, to some extent, although it probably doesn't scale well.
