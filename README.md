# recommendation-engine

This is a client-side computed recommendation-engine based on user affinity, written in JavaScript, using firebase as a datastore.

It uses Facebook connect to gather information about a user's favorite movies and provide recommendations on other movies the user might like.

## What?

Yes, it's kind of bizarre to write a recommendation engine in client-side JavaScript.
